# Personal Arch Configuration

This is my personal Arch Linux configuration. It includes my dotfiles, scripts, and other helpers for replicating a similar environment.

## Installation

**Prerequisites**

- Arch Linux (Set up with [installation guilde](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/installation_guide))
- `git`
- `python`



## Usage

The general usage of this repository is through the scripts.

### Available Scripts

- `base_install.py`: Installs all the base packages and configurations. You can specify a specific configuration script to run if you want to install only part of the configuration.
- `health.py`: Checks the health of the configurations. It checks for missing packages, missing configurations, and other issues.
